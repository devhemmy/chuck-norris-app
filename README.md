## Technologies used

- React using NextJS: Nextjs server-side rendering the app instead of client-side rendering on plain React which can improve performance and statically generate files on Build time them so they can be served over CDN which can also improve the SEO

- EmotionJs and rebassJs :
  Emotion js is very performant and flexible where it lets me write only the CSS that I am gonna use without losing performance due to duplication or unused CSS files and I used rebassJs with it where it gives me out of the box CSS ready components to avoid writing so much CSS and focuses more on performance

* Cypress :
  is an End To End that speeds up the testing process of the user experience and helps to catch bugs by simulating the user actions, also it is super easy to set up and the learning curve is minimal
